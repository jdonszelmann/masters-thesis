\chapter{A}\label{chap:a}

As part of this thesis, a paper was submitted to the \ac{SLE} conference.
Unfortunately it was not accepted, mainly due to the size of the related work, something we expanded in this thesis.
The paper was co-written by two of the supervisors of this thesis: DaniÃ«l A. A. Pelsmaeker and Danny M. Groenewegen.
This thesis is essentially an expanded version of this paper, with more content, details and explanation, also addressing some of the concerns raised in the reviews.
Nonetheless, we felt that it was appropriate to include the original, unaltered paper in this appendix.
