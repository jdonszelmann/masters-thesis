%\todo{maybe merge with the previous chapter}

In chapter~\ref{chap:code-exploration-services}, we discussed what code exploration services are, and
concluded that few code exploration services are supported outside editors, while programmers spend
a lot of time exploring code outside an editor.

% Why are so few code exploration services currently provided?
% Requirement that they often need to be provided statically
% M x N problem for code exploration services just like editor services
% For editors the solution seems to be a standard that is both supported my many languages and many editors
% If we do things statically, it makes sense for things to generate a file which can then be interpreted to generate html/latex/any other output
% What kind of requirements does such a format have?
% What's the best format?
