\chapter{Tradeoffs of an index format}\label{chap:tradeoffs-of-an-index-format}

\todo[inline]{
I'm not going to talk about my own impl of code exploration services at all here.
Just about all the tradeoffs that exists, and many possible solutions.
In a next chapter, we will actually walk through the process of implementing this, and
try the different options to report on their viability.
