\chapter{Code Viewer Services}
\label{chap:code-viewer-services}

Although a programmer's job is to write programs, in practice a lot of their time is spent reading code.

or trying to understand code from last week.
Especially in teams, reviewing code others wrote is also a common task programmers do, which involves reading code.
