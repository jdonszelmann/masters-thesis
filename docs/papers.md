## Decoupling Language and Editor - The Impact of the Language Server Protocol on Textual Domain-Specific Languages

* About decoupling a DSL from a specific editor by using LSP
* References Spoofax :)

## Language-parametric static semantic code completion

TODO: make nicer
* Only about code completion. Useless for me?

## Towards Language-Parametric Refactorings

* Related to Spoofax
* refactorings based on the spoofax definition of the language, which then work for any language made in spoofax
* Using the scope graph
* Tiny! 2 pages haha
*

## Experience with ANSI C markup language for a cross-referencer

* They make a cross referencer
* their question: How to store the info needed for cross referencing c programs in xml?
* Lots has changed since 2002
* Their approach:
  * Store the entire syntax tree of c in XML so it has to be parsed only once
  * Try to unify redundancies (`unsigned long == long unsigned`) adding non-canonical notation
* Mentions lots of approaches others took to accomplish this: worth a look, though old
  *

## Portable Editor Services

* AESI: maximal interface supported by all editors explored with minimum requirements for implementors
* Starts with adapting spoofax to jetbrains (which seems like they experienced some issues)
* Then goes into what editor plugins are and compares how xtext generates plugins for a number of editors?
* Comparing editor services:
  * Derives 13 editor services (from `erdweg2013state`) expected in editors, and lists how they are supported across common editors
  * Ranks the editors in a ternary manner, as also seen in other related papers
  * Good description of how exactly syntax colouring works in different editors, including textmate's interesting system with classes
  * Interestingly: mentions ctags
* Chapter 5: Adaptable Editor Services Interface
  * Refers to `erdweg2013state` which seems useful
  * 
* Conclusion clearly mentions contributions, which seems useful

## The State of the Art in Language Workbenches

* Has an awesome tree of important features of a language workbench
  * Which of these features translate to useful code exploration services?
