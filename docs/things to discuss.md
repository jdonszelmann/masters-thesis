* Update for Jesper:
  * "A generic format for code viewer services"
  * Ctags are interesting and may provide part of the information needed to construct this format
* New for Daniel & Danny:
  * MARE: Finally convinced Koen, took a while because he didn't respond to mails
  * Read Daniel's MSC thesis (interestingly, already mentions ctags)
    * Referencing many websites?
    * Did you consider extending LSP to work in other editors instead of creating AESI and making an LSP adapter for it?
  * From Daniel's paper got to Erdweg's "The State of the Art in Language Workbenches"
    * Rewrote the list of useful editor services to a list of useful code viewer services
    * Made a list of requirements for information needed to provide each of them
  * Decoded agda's interface format, compiled my own version of agda which spits it out. Mostly learned that it's literally the internal typechecking structure but serialized
* Next week:
  - [ ] Found papers specifically about semantic highlighting which I want to read
  - [ ] Find out exactly how other services store the information needed for each of the feature
  - [ ] start writing down something in thesis form
  - [ ] Message Hendrik van Antwerpen
  - [ ] See what information can be combined?
  - [ ] look at constraints/requirements for this in different languages. look at a lot of languages
