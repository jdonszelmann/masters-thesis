* Update for Jesper:
  * "A generic format for code viewer services"
  * Ctags are interesting and may provide part of the information needed to construct this format
  * MARE: Finally convinced Koen, took a while because he didn't respond to mails
  * Read Daniel's MSC thesis (interestingly, already mentions ctags)
  * From Daniel's paper got to Erdweg's "The State of the Art in Language Workbenches"
  * Decoded agda's interface format, compiled my own version of agda which spits it out. Mostly learned that it's literally the internal typechecking structure but serialized
* New for Daniel & Danny:
  * Found papers specifically about semantic highlighting which I want to read
    * Had some interesting terms, like 
    * Some unconvincing results
    * Do want to investigate more
  * start writing down something in thesis form
    * Wrote a few pages
  * See what information can be combined?
    * See data format
    * Reference resolution and colouring are the odd ones out
    * Everything else can be implemented with "annotation at span"
  * look at constraints/requirements for reference resolution in different languages. look at a lot of languages
    * Scala: everything is possible
      * multiple references
      * multiple definition sites
  * Talked extensively with Peter Mosses
* Next week:
  - [ ] Find out exactly how other services store the information needed for each of the feature
  - [ ] Message Hendrik van Antwerpen
  - [ ] Read Peter Mosses' 2016 paper on CBS
  - [ ] Write more thesis, at least a few pages more
  - [ ]
