* This week:
  - efficiency of generation itself: out of scope
  - talk about my views on the relation with stack-graphs
  - wrote about mxn in code exploration, and the requirement for static analysis. 
  - working on a piece about the need for efficiency of generation, and efficiency of consumption, and the trade-offs
  - 


language server index:

cache invalidation based on language unspecified?
supports incementality
has a different purpose

except! stackgraphs paper seems to claim the purpose is very similar, the batch processing stuff
that's actually interesting, whether I need to figure out if I need to find all lsp requests possible on a file

source maps has a different purpose but the file format might be interesting
find advantages of different normalisation levels

research:
simple format
advantages of compression/normalization
store token lengths only? advantage or disadvantage?
main goal: where lies the tradeoff between generation and consumption

stackgraphs not interesting except motivation and related work
speed of generation is not important
