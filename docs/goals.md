# High level Goals

Create a system that:
* analyzes programs written in multiple languages
* outputs its results in a format that works for any of the supported languages (if possible general enough for as many languages as possible)
* allows external tools to use the precomputed analysis to cheaply and *statically* provide code navigation like in IDEs

Informal goal:
Make it easy for all languages to be displayed nicely on a website while allowing code navigation/inspection.
