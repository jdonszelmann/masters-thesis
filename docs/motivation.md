Research question:
What is the best data format to store code metadata to provide code exploration services.


As a description:

Trying to find the best data format to store code metadata. 
The format should be very easy to *generate*, and should be generic enough to work for many different programming languages.
And it should be possible to use the stored metadata to provide services to aid the reading of code without an IDE.

Metrics to consider and optimize:
Compatibility across languages
Ease of format generation
Ease of usage of the format
Compatibility with existing formats
